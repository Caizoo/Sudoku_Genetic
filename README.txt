To run the search, open the file 'sudoku_genetic.py' to edit in your text editor of choice, where at the 
bottom of the file you can change the parameters for population size and number of generations.

Using the command line, direct to the directory of the file 'sudoku_genetic.py' and run the command 
python sudoku_genetic.py

This will run the search for each of the 3 grids given and show the resulting completed board and the 
fitness of the best guess. It's important to have the grid files in the same directory as the sudoku_genetic.py
file.

To run the sudoku_grapher code, which is the code used for the experiments, you must have a working copy of
Anaconda Jupyter Notebook, where you can define the functions in the sudoku_genetic and sudoku_grapher files, and
using the 'run' code in the sudoku_grapher file can repeat the experiments. I will make comments in the sudoku_graph 
file in order to show what should be split into each cell in the notebook, so it can be run one at a time.
The functions minus the 'run' code should be defined in the notebook first.

The code in sudoku_extra can be used in the same way as above in Anaconda Jupyter Notebook in order to repeat the 
extra experiments regarding the mutation and truncation rate parameters.
